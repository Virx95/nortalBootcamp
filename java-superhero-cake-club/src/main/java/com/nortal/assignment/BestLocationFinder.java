     * <ul>
     * <li>All superheroes can travel straight to any of the rooftops</li>
     * <li>Best location is the one where the longest distance that any superhero must travel is the shortest</li>
     * <li>In case the longest distance is the same for multiple rooftops, use the shortest distance as a secondary comparator</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <b>Example</b>
     * Consider the following example: http://bit.ly/superherosample
     * We have two possible rooftops and two superheros.
     * For Rooftop 1 the longest distance that any of the superheroes must travel is 3 km
     * For Rooftop 2 the longest distance that any of the superheroes must travel is 5 km
     * Thus Rooftop 1 wins.
     * <p>
     * <b>Note:</b> This example used km but you are given a list of special superhero coordinates.
     * There is no need to convert any units.
     *
     * @param rooftops    List of possible rooftops where superheroes can meet
     * @param superheroes
     * @return best Rooftop for cake club meeting
